"""Shared pytest configuration for the PGA rangehood tests.

Home Assistant's test harness (``pytest-homeassistant-custom-component``)
provides the ``hass`` fixture and the ``enable_custom_integrations`` fixture.
Repo root is added to ``sys.path`` via ``pythonpath = .`` in ``pytest.ini`` so
``custom_components`` is importable from any checkout.
